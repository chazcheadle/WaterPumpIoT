# WaterPumpIoT
Keep track of how long a water pump has run 

This program will send 'Start' and 'Stop' events for a water pump to know how long until the water filter needs to be changed.

Project goals:
- Learn how to connect devices to the Internet of Things (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things)
- Experiment with MQTT (http://mqtt.org)
- Connect project to Adafruit.io
- Determine what hardware is best suited to sensing water pump activity
- Determine what hardware is can be used to get the data from the device to the internet
